## Overview

A zero dimensional (lumped parameters) circulatory model including six compartments (aorta, arteries, arterioles, capillaries, veins, ventricle) is employed in the **PyMyoVent** framework.

## Theory

- The blood volume in each compartment depends on the blood flow gradient across the compartment.

![volume](volume.png)

- Where *Q<sub>(i to j)</sub>* represents the blood flow between compartment *i* and *j*.

- The blood flow between compartments is governed by Ohmâ€™s law.

- The blood pressure in each compartment, except the ventricle, is related to the corresponding blood volume with a compliance factor.

## Parameters 

The parameters for the **circulatory** module are tuned in a way to mimic the phisology of a healthy adult. Their values are located at the *circulation* section of the instruction file.
