### Things you should check first

Okay, something has gone wrong, and you're not quite sure what to do.

Here are some good steps.

+ Go back and run the demos
  
If those don't work, it's unlikely that anything else will work.

You could ask somebody who knows about computers to help you, and if that doesn't work, consider copying your work to a new directory (in case you need to come back to), delete the PyMyoVent folder, and start again with a clean install.

If you're still stuck, check whether somebody has alerted us to the same problem

+ Go to the [PyMyoVent respository](https://github.com/Campbell-Muscle-Lab/PyMyoVent)
  + Click on the Issues tab

If so, we know about it, and are probably working on it.
