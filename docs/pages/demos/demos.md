- This tab helps you to run various simulations using **PyMyoVent** to get more familiar with the software.

- Before start running demos, make sure you have set up the required [environment](../environment/environment.html) beforehand.  

- In general, for running a user-defined simulation, the user needs to define the proper input files and then feed
them into the software code.

- However, for running demos, the main three [input files](../structures/structures.html) are already
created and just need to be called by the new user.
