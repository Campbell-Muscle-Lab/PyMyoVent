## Overview
**PyMyoVent** is written in [Python version 3](http://www.python.org) and uses a number of packages and libraries.
We at the [Campbell-Muscell-Lab](http://sites.google.com/g.uky.edu/campbellmusclelab), highly recommend every users to use [Anaconda](http://www.anaconda.org) as the Python environment management.


## Setting up Python environement
[Python How Tos](http://campbell-muscle-lab.github.io/howtos_Python/) helps you to setup the required python environment and management usefule for running a simulation with **PyMyoVent**.

## Using an Existing Environment 
You can also use an existing environment for running **PyMyoVent** framework. Similar to the other software repositories developed by [Campbell-Muscell-Lab](http://sites.google.com/g.uky.edu/campbellmusclelab), there is an `environment.yml` file located at `path_to_PyMyoVent_repo\environment` directory that includes all the required packages for running **PyMyoVent** project. An individual user can create a local environment using the exisiting file and activate it prior to running **PyMyoVent** framework.

If this is your first time dealing with creating local environments for a project, you might need to check this [link](http://campbell-muscle-lab.github.io/howtos_Python/pages/anaconda/anaconda.html#getting-started-with-environments) first. 

## Cloning PyMyoVent Repository
[PyMyoVent repository](http://github.com/Campbell-Muscle-Lab/PyMyoVent) is hosted on [Github](http://github.com) website. The best way for cloning the repository and have the version control over the source code is using [GitHub Desktop](http://desktop.github.com/) software.
