## Overview 

This is the homepage for **PyMyoVent**, a software written in Python language for simulating a single ventricle pumping blood through a closed circulation.

**PyMyoVent** is built on various sub-modules and trying to simulate a multi-scale modeling method for the left ventricle. 

**PyMyoVent** is originally developed by [Kenneth S. Campbell et al.](http://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2020.01043/abstract) and still is getting updated while other projects are utilizing it.

Here is shown a simulated single heart beat results via **PyMyoVent** published in [Kenneth S. Campbell et al.](http://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2020.01043/abstract) work.
